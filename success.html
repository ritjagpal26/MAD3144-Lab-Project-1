           “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”

         </h1>
<p>
Habits can MAKE you, but they can also BREAK you. One of the key differences between the successful & unsuccessful, between those at the highest level, and those destined for the common life, is HABITS.
Develop strong daily habits:

<div class="items">


<ol class="items">
<li>SET GOALS.</li>
<li>MAKE A CLEAR PLAN.</li>
<li>EXERCISE.</li>
<li>READ MORE, LEARN MORE.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
Every new strong habit you make will plant a seed of success in your future. All these little seeds will grow over time. EVERY ACTION MATTERS, every single day.
